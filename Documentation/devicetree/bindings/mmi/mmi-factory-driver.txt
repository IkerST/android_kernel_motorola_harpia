mmi-factory-driver

This is a mechanism to use the standard device tree to export the GPIOs
required in factory test environments. It is dependent upon environment
variable of /chosen/mmi,factory-cable being present.  If the property
does not exist, the platform driver will not probe.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mmi,factory-support-msm8960"

- gpios: array of GPIOs and GPIOF flags to request, configure, and export by
    the driver.  The flags are standard GPIO flag bitmasks:

        GPIOF_DIR_OUT           (0 << 0)
        GPIOF_DIR_IN            (1 << 0)
        GPIOF_INIT_LOW          (0 << 1)
        GPIOF_INIT_HIGH         (1 << 1)
        GPIOF_OPEN_DRAIN        (1 << 2)
        GPIOF_OPEN_SOURCE       (1 << 3)

- gpio-names: matching label to apply to the above GPIO list. It must contain
    same number of entries as the gpio array.

Example:

factory_support {
	compatible = "mmi,factory-support-msm8960";

	gpios = <&msmgpio 75 0x2>, /* GPIOF_DIR_OUT | GPIOF_INIT_HIGH */
		<&msmgpio 98 0x1>; /* GPIOF_DIR_IN */
	gpio-names = "factory_kill_disable",
		     "temp_sensor";
};
