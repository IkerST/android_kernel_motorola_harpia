Future Communication Mobile Digital TV FC8180 device driver

The FC8180 is connected to host processor via SPI.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fci,isdbt"
- reg:  Spi slave address, give it 0.
- irq-gpio :  GPIO used for interrupt.
- enable-gpio: GPIO used for power enabling device.
- enable-active-high: Polarity of GPIO is active high (default is low).
- pinctrl-names,pinctrl-0: the pincontrol setting to configure muxing properly
			for pins that connect to FC8180.

Optional properties:
- qcom,bbm-xtal-freq: the clock speed of external XTAL or PMIC clock in khz.
			If not set default is 37400 khz. be sure to set it correctly if the
			clock speed is not equal to the default value.
- isdbt_vdd-supply: power supply needed to power device.
			be sure to set it if the power supply is not turned on by default.
- qcom,vdd-min-max-voltage:  minimum and maximum voltage in uv for vdd-supply.
			If not set , driver won't change the voltage of vdd-supply and
			the default voltage of vdd-supply is set by pmic driver.
- isdbt_ant-supply:  power supply needed to power the antenna of device.
- qcom,ant-min-max-voltage:   minimum and maximum voltage in uv for ant-supply.
			If not set, driver won't change the voltage of ant-supply and
			the default voltage of ant-supply is set by pmic driver.
- anten-gpio: GPIO used for switching on the antenna.
- clocks: phandles to the pmic clock source.
- clock-names: name of the pmic clock.
- qcom,using-pmic: with pmic clock sources( BBCLK2) this must be set to 1 and
			require clocks, clock-names entries to work propperly.  If external
			XTAL clock is used, this entry is not needed or set it to 0.
- spi-max-frequency : maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz, it should be
			equal to or less than qcom,bbm-xtal-freq.

Example:

&spi_5 {
	status = "/chosen", "mmi,dtv", "true";
	fci_dtv: fc8180@0 {
		status = "/chosen", "mmi,dtv", "true";
		compatible = "fci,isdbt";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <19200000>;
		irq-gpio = <&msm_gpio 52 0>;
		anten-gpio = <&msm_gpio 50 0>;
		enable-gpio = <&msm_gpio 51 0>;
		enable-active-high;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&dtv_output_default &dtv_input_default>;
		clocks = <&clock_rpm clk_bb_clk2>;
		clock-names = "dtv_refclk";
		isdbt_vdd-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;
		isdbt_ant-supply = <&pm8916_l17>;
		qcom,vdd-min-max-voltage = <1800000 1800000>;
		qcom,ant-min-max-voltage = <2850000 2850000>;
		qcom,bbm-xtal-freq = <19200>;
		qcom,using-pmic = <1>;
	};
};
